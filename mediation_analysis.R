### Requirements:

### 1) Show that X is correlated with Y. Regress Y on X to estimate and test the path c
### 2) This step establishes that there is an effect that may be mediated.
### Show that X is correlated with M. Regress M on X to estimate and test path a
### 3) This step essentially involves treating the mediator as if it were an outcome variable.
### Show that M affects Y. Regress Y on both X and M to estimate and test path b
### 4) Note that it is not sufficient just to correlate the mediator with the outcome; the mediator and the outcome may be correlated because they are both caused by the input variable X. Thus, the input variable X must be controlled in establishing the effect of the mediator on the outcome.
### To establish that M completely mediates the X-Y relationship, the effect of X on Y controlling for M (path câ€²
### ) should be zero. The effects in both Steps 3 and 4 are estimated in the same equation.

### Only 2 and 3 are required. 

### How to meet them? 
### Our functional model is bacteria --> BMI --> depression AND bacteria --> depression. 
### 1) -> Differentially abundant bacteria (i.e, X bacteria are correlated with Y depression). We will select all bacteria in simple DAA
### 2) -> Mediator (BMI) is correlated to X (bacterial species). 
### 3)
